Welcome to your **MERN Stack Learning Repository!**
This repo will be your personal coding notebook throughout the course — from JavaScript basics to full React projects.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
mern-learning/
│
├── basic-foundations/
│   ├── variables/
│   ├── loops/
│   ├── functions/
│   └── objects/
│
├── assignments/
│   ├── functions-basic/
│   ├── callback-settimeout/
│   ├── callback-setinterval/
│   ├── promises-intro/

└── react-js/
    ├── introduction/
    ├── components/

```

**Rules for folder names:**

* Use only lowercase letters.
* No spaces — use hyphens instead.
* Each topic or assignment goes into its own folder.

✅ Example: `functions-basic`
❌ Wrong: `Functions Basic`, `functionsBasic`, `functions basic`

## 🧠 Purpose of Each Folder

**basic-foundations/**
For all practice code from early JS topics — variables, loops, arrays, functions, objects, etc.

**assignments/**
Contains your weekly or topic-based assignments. Each assignment should be organized into a separate folder with its topic name.

**react-js/**
All React-related code: small apps, component practice, hooks, etc.

## 🪜 Steps to Maintain Your Repo

1. Clone your repository to your local system.
2. Create topic folders inside the correct section (for example, inside `assignments/`).
3. Add your `.js`, `.html`, `.css` files inside the topic folder.
4. Save and commit your changes.
5. Push them to GitHub regularly.

---

## 🧾 Example Commit Message

```
add callback-settimeout assignment
```

Keep your commits simple and clear. Avoid unnecessary text or emojis.

---

## 💡 Tips

* Practice small snippets daily and store them inside `basic-foundations/`.
* Always test your code before committing.
* Keep the repo clean — one topic per folder.
* This repository will become your **portfolio** to showcase your progress and learning journey.
